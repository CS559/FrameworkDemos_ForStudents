# Textures for CS559 Assignments

The dice texture is taken from a U Washington (the other UW) assignment.
https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse458/11au/content/exercises/uv_exercise.html. The Assignment is for Maya, but the texture is useful for us as well.

The directory "HDRIHeaven" has environment maps downloaded from HDRIHeaven.com. These are CC0. I converted them to regular images using PhotoShop and then used https://www.360toolkit.co/convert-spherical-equirectangular-to-cubemap to convert them to Cube Maps. Note that 360toolkit swaps the front and bottom.

The "textures" 4x4, 4x4bw, gradient, gradient-dip, paintBump, pixl_r_normal, rminus and rplus were painted by Mike Gleicher as simple examples.

The Sky examples, Rock and Metal were found on the web by Young Wu.
+ The rock is from https://3dtextures.me/
+ The metal is from https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterNormalMap.html
+ The sphere background is from https://texturify.com/
+ The box background is from http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures
